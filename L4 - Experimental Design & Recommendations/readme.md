# Experimental Design & Recommendations

## Experimental Design

Within the experimental design file, there are three main contents:

- Concepts of Experiment Design. This includes what it means to run an experiment, and how this differs from observational studies. Topics include not only what to include in an experimental design, but also what to watch out for when designing an experiment.

- Statistical Considerations in Testing. This includes statistical techniques and considerations used when evaluating the data collected during an experiment. Knowledge of inferential statistics is pre-required. 

- A/B Testing Case Study. This includes analyzing data related to a change on a web page designed to increase purchasers of the software.

## Recommendation Engines

Within the file, there are two main contents: 

- Introduction to Recommendation Engines. This includes the main ideas associated with recommendation engines. This includes techniques and measures of effectiveness.

- Matrix Factorization for Recommendations. This includes one of the most popular techniques for recommendation engines known as FunkSVD. It also includes bringing together a number of techniques to make recommendations for a number of different scenarios
