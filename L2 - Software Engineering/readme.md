# Software Engineering

Software engineering skills are increasingly important for data scientists. I include some of the best practices for writing software, such as 
- Clean and modular code
- Code efficiently
- Refactoring
- Documentation
- Version control 
- Test code
- Code review

I also include the basics of object-oriented programming to build python packages.
